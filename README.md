## Info
* **Author(s)**: BinarySemaphore
* **Version**: 0.1.1
* **Description**: Physic simulation from scratch (in Unity/Ylands).

### Released Builds
* Not yet released

### Preface
I started making this in a game called "[Ylands](https://ylands.com/)".
This was in their in-game editor to allow blocks to follow a physics simulation.
The end goal, to destroy "blueprints" (structures built in the game - think Minecraft buildings) by throwing other blocks or an explosive force.

I was posting progress on the Ylands official discord:

I decided to continue my work in Unity to allow for additional debugging and to expand on it later.

See the `from-ylands` branch for the ported code.

### Intent
Continue working towards a simple physics simulation in Unity with good performance.

Eventually port back to Ylands and continue there until a custom tool can be released.

After release, continue in Unity and add more complexity until I'm tired of working on physics stuff.


## Setup and Usage
Describe how everything fits together at some point.


## Examples
Walk through some examples one day.


## Documentation

### Source Web Documentation (via GitHub Pages)
[Web Docs](https://binarysemaphore.github.io/PhysicsFromScratch/)


## Updating Web Documentation for GitHub Pages

### Generating HTML Web Docs
Open Doxygen's [Doxywizard](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
* File > Open and open `Doxyfile` located in ["./Doxygen/"](../main/Doxygen)
* Click the "Run" tab
* Select "Run doxygen"
* Everything in ["./Doxygen/html/"](../main/Doxygen/html) should now be updated

Commit the updated docs, push to your branch, and create a pull request.

### Update GitHub Pages
Pages will automatically be updated when merged into `main` branch.
The "./docs/" (*configured in GitHub to host pages*) directory is a symbolic link to "./Doxygen/html/".

Note: *It can take 10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update.*
